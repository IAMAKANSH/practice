its a structural design pattern
it lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object
A proxy controls access to the original object allowing you to perform something either before or after the request
gets through to the original object

Advantages
1.Access control/protection given to proxy object.
This is when you want only specific clients to be able to use the service object
Caching request results(Caching proxy)
This is when  you need to cache  results of client request and manage the life cycle of the cache especially
if results are quite large
Logging request.This is when you want to keep the history of request to the service object
