Decorator design pattern is structural design pattern
Its allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure

Example

I have a ice cream shop and right now we have 3 different types of ice cream
Icecream Interface::
->cost()

Implements IceCream
1.Chocolate
2.Vanilla
3.Mango

Now we decide to add 2 more new flavours in our shop

4. Strawberry
5. ButterScotch

1. Idea we will implement like the above

2. IceCream interface (cost() method)
   BasicIceCream implement icecream
   IceCreamDecorator interface
   all other icecream flavour implements decorator interface
